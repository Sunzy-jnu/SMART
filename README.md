# SMART
SMART is a spatially Regularized Deconvolution Model with Smoothness Constraints that simultaneously estimates cell type proportions and cell-type-specific gene expression for each spot in spatial transcriptomics.
# Background
SMART is a spatial transcriptome deconvolution model based on spatial smoothing regularization.  It performs archetypal analysis on single-cell reference data to fully activate the utility of cell type heterogeneity;  meanwhile, it incorporates spatial smoothing terms during the deconvolution process and constructs a spatial adjacency matrix—specifically addressing the deficiency of inadequate biological similarity mining between adjacent spots and significantly enhancing the spatial consistency of cell distribution.
